    <p>Sunday is my favorite day of the week. I like it because on Sunday, I watch football. On other days, I also get to watch football but not all day. There are other sports on other days to watch on TV. Sunday lunch is a favorite of mine because I eat with my father in front of the TV. All the other days, I have to eat at the table which is less fun. Some days my dad doesn’t make it home from work until after I’m in bed. Some weeks my dad travels, and I don’t see him for several days. The highlight of the day is when we watch the Dolphins play. Dad and I get so excited, we yell and cheer together. The thing that I like to do best in the world is watch TV with my dad.</p>
